   - Updates and fixes to documentation.

   - Unify license/author/copyright to main file.

0.002_01
   - Add more core roles for use by extensions which need to make
     a connection.

   - Rename to Message::Passing, as it's a better description
     of what we do, and will cause less confusion with other projects.

0.002
    - Support a --daemonize option in logstash scripts.

    - Support a --pid_file option in logstash scripts.

    - Allow inputs to coerce a hash in output_to to an output,
      which is more verbose than the DSL, but also allows you
      to setup simple output chains from a simple data structure
      (such as you might read in from a config file).

    - Explicitly turn off output buffering in STDOUT output.
      This means that piping the STDOUT output to a file (for
      logging or debugging purposes) works as expected, without
      batching writes.

    - Change logstash script to use the perl interpreter it is
      installed with, rather than the one in $PATH right now.

    - Fix issue using Filter::T in the DSL

    - Fix multiple inputs going to the same output.
